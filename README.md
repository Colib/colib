OPEN STARTUP
============

This project will be run as openly as possible while still being a commercial project. I hope to use [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/open) and other tools for this. [@GetColib](https://twitter.com/getcolib) will be your best source of information on the project.

CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

Contributions are welcome and will be credited to you and remain open source if accepted. Please do note that this is a commercial project though and for now I have no idea of how to compensate your contributions. I am working on that and welcome any suggestions. The license is [MIT](LICENSE) though so you are free to do as you please with the code.

You can read up on [GitFlow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), the preferred style of contributions but essentially;

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a well named branch
3. Commit often
4. Write tests and run them and existing ones
5. Create a Pull Request for your contribution
6. I will review it and accept or reject

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
======================

Continuous integration is handled by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).
